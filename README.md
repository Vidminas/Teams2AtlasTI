# Convert Teams Transcripts to Atlas.ti

This utility converts an automated transcript created by the online video conference service [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), to support the popular qualitative analysis tool [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com/).

Although since March 2021, Atlas.ti supports VTT transcripts, a couple of bugs in Teams prevent them from working well. This utility helps to work around them.

See [the hosted pages on Github Pages](https://vidminas.github.io/Teams2AtlasTI/index.html) for instructions and usage.
