# Convert Teams Transcripts to Atlas.ti

This utility converts an automated transcript created by the online video conference service [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), to support the popular qualitative analysis tool [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com/).

Although since March 2021, Atlas.ti supports VTT transcripts, a couple of bugs in Teams prevent them from working well. This utility helps to work around them until Teams fix their transcripts. I only expect this to be useful temporarily, so I don't plan to maintain the project, but if you'd like to improve or extend it, pull requests are welcome.

See [the hosted pages on Github Pages](https://vidminas.github.io/Teams2AtlasTI/index.html) for instructions and usage.
